# Sugar-Filling-Machine

- PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
- Individual project

•	The aim of this project is to program a Siemens-Logo PLC using the FBD language with the LOGO!Soft Comfort software. This PLC is charge of operating a sugar filling machine.

•	Work in both Automatic and Manual modes (as desired)

•	This machine includes five sensors, two conveyors, two jacks, a switch, a valve, LEDs, an alarm.

•	The system takes into account the errors that can occur such as sensor error, lack of boxes error, jack error, load cell, etc.

•	In addition, our system calculates a predefined maintenance time (after 100 hours of activation of each mode) and special keys to reset the process.

•	Output of the project: 
  o	LOGO!Soft Comfort file (with comments to explain)

•	Skills token from this project:
  -	Programming languages:
    o	FBD: Function Block Diagram
    o	LADDER
  -	PLCs: 
    o	Siemens – LOGO 
    o	DELTA
  -	Good thinking in such a concept of PLC programming.
